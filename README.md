Intro slides for the training session at JISC MRD workshop October 2012.

Please note: this LaTeX document won't compile without my University of Bath beamer theme and the CSCT logo somewhere in your `texmf` path. If you want to reuse it, you'll need to use your own theme and remove the reference to the logo.
